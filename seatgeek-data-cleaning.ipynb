    "## Project Description\n",
    "Cleaning concert data from SeatGeek that were previously extracted using a data pipeline in my previous project. We will use pandas to examine what data is available, deal with missing values and tidy up formatting. This dataset may be used in several projects including but not limited to creating interactive dashboards showing upcoming events for someone trying to sell their tickets or see what events are available and k-means clustering to group the concerts by category. I'm curious to find out what unsupervised learning will discover!"

In this project, \"I want to have multiple purposes for this data. 1) for an interactive dashboard and 2) machine learning if possible. I can get super ambitious, unrealistic at times, but would love to eventually see this dataset come to life!"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we used our ny-concert data from SeatGeek. We took stock of missing data and decided how we were going to deal with NaN prices and 0 value columns. We went through pricing and replaced the missing average and median prices with the median price of each respective column. We decided to leave the highest and lowest price columns as is because there were really no tickets available for those events. Because the venue_score was linked to ticket sales, I replaced the 0 value venue_scores with the median score in congruence with what we did with the ticket prices. I left venue_capacity as is as I did not have an optimal way of handling it. I also left ticket listing count at missing because there were no tickets on sale for those events. I handled missing zipcodes by googling them, easily because there were only 3. Then I made missing performer_genres in to its own category. I converted the string date columns into datetime. Finally we dropped a redundant column as all events were concerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was tricky deciding what to do with missing values. At the back of my mind, it always occurred to me whether we put something there or not, the value is not 100% true. I think this is a limitation that I wonder if someone could tell me what would be the best way to handle a certain NaN value. Nonetheless, I tried to justify my reasoning for dealing with those values. In the future, I would like to use the datetime to get a look at what events occur during what time of the day. \n",
    "\n",
    "Happy to get feedback on my project. Thank you.\n",
